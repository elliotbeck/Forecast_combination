# The Hedged Random Forest

This repo contains all codes needed to produce the results as shown in the 
paper Hedging Forecast Combinations With an Application to the Random Forest 
(https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15384). There is also a package which contains the
hedged random forest functionality (see https://github.com/elliotbeck/hedgedrf).
